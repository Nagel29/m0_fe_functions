# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
  * I would say it's currently not a strength or weakness, I'm just doing okay with time management. My main tip would be to expect things to take longer than you would like them to take. Trying to power through something may result in it taking longer than it would if you just took your time.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
  * A function is a set of instructions that you tell the computer to remember so that you can later tell it to act out those instructions.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
  * Parameters are variables within the function definition. You can name them whatever you want (along guidelines). You can have multiple variables.
  * Arguments are actual data that you use when calling the function. This actual data is then applied to the variables that you created when defining the function. Number of arguments must be equal to number of parameters. Arguments can various data types.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
  * On question 4 of functions.js, was the if statement the best or most efficient way to solve that?
